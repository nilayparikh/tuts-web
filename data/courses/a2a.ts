          answer:
            "They can, but without a common protocol you need custom integration for every pair of agents. A2A provides a standard discovery mechanism (Agent Card), task format, and streaming contract so any A2A-compliant agent can talk to any other.",

      "Connecting agents built with different frameworks typically requires extensive custom integration work. A2A solves this with an open protocol that standardizes how agents <strong>discover</strong> each other and <strong>communicate</strong> — regardless of which model, language, or framework they were built on.",
      "In this course, you'll build a complete healthcare multi-agent system: three specialized agents using different frameworks, each wrapped as an A2A server. You'll build the clients to talk to them and orchestrate them into both sequential and hierarchical workflows. Along the way you'll see exactly how A2A and MCP complement each other — MCP connects agents to external data; A2A connects agents to each other.",
