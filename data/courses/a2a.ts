            "A2A is a communication contract, not a framework. It defines how agents talk (discovery, task lifecycle, streaming) without constraining what they do internally. This is why agents built with six different frameworks can interoperate seamlessly through a single protocol.",

    aboutParagraphs: [
      "Most agents today work in isolation. They call tools through MCP, fetch data, execute tasks. But give three agents — built with different frameworks by different teams — a shared problem, and you are back to writing custom glue for every pair. The integration count grows with N. A2A removes that ceiling: each agent implements the protocol once, and any two agents that speak A2A can discover and work with each other without any bespoke adapter code.",
      "The protocol is precise about what it standardises. An <strong>Agent Card</strong> at <code>/.well-known/agent.json</code> declares the agent's name, capabilities, skills, and authentication scheme. Tasks move through seven defined states — submitted, working, input-required, auth-required, completed, cancelled, failed. Messages carry typed Parts (text, data, files). Streaming responses arrive over <strong>Server-Sent Events</strong>. Authentication (OAuth 2.0, mTLS, or API key) is declared in the card, not negotiated per-call. Everything runs over JSON-RPC 2.0.",
      "In this course you build the full picture. A QA agent from scratch using the A2A Python SDK. Then the same loan validation problem solved six ways — Microsoft Agent Framework, Google ADK, LangGraph backed by MCP tool servers, CrewAI, the OpenAI Agents SDK, and a bare-metal loop that shows what every framework automates. Each runs as a separate process on a fixed port. The capstone connects all six: a loan pipeline where AI handles 80% of decisions automatically, humans review the rest through a React dashboard, and every step is traced with OpenTelemetry.",
